Some of the earliest evidence of salt 
processing dates to around 6,000 BC, 
when people living in the area of present-day 
Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; 
a salt-works in China dates to approximately the same period. 
Salt was also prized by the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, 
the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites, Egyptians, and 
the Indians. Salt became an important article of trade 
and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, 
along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara 
on camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for 
salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to 
raise tax revenues. Salt is used in religious ceremonies 
and has other cultural and traditional significance.
